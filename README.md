## Requirements

- 7z (only for DIP creation script)

## Installation

Follow each of the steps below to install automation-tools:

1. Make the following directories:

    ```shell
    sudo mkdir -p /usr/lib/archivematica/automation-tools &&
    sudo mkdir /usr/share/python/automation-tools &&
    sudo mkdir -p /var/log/archivematica/automation-tools &&
    sudo mkdir /var/archivematica/automation-tools &&
    sudo mkdir /etc/archivematica/automation-tools
    ```

2. Change ownership of the directories to be owned by archivematica (group
   archivematica) and directories to be owned by the user:

    ```shell
    sudo chown archivematica:archivematica /var/log/archivematica/automation-tools \
          /var/archivematica/automation-tools \
          /usr/lib/archivematica/automation-tools \
          /usr/share/python/automation-tools \
           /etc/archivematica/automation-tools
    ```

    In case of using the automation tools with a Docker setup the archivematica
    user and group don't exist:

    ```shell
    sudo useradd archivematica
    ```

3. Clone the automation-tools repository into your `usr/lib` directory:

    ```shell
    cd /usr/lib/archivematica/automation-tools/
    git clone https://github.com/artefactual/automation-tools.git .
    ```

    In case you want to run the automation-tools using [cron](#configuration), the
    automation tools need to be owned by the archivemtatica user:

    ```shell
    sudo chown archivematica:archivematica /usr/lib/archivematica/automation-tools/
    ```

4. Set up a Python virtual environment:

    ```shell
    cd /usr/share/python/automation-tools
    virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r /usr/lib/archivematica/automation-tools/requirements.txt
    ```

5. (Optional) Update and retrieve required packages:

    ```shell
    apt-get update
    apt-get install p7zip-full
    ```

## Usage

To use automation-tools, copy the scripts you want to use into your
`/etc/archivematica/automation-tools` directory.

`transfers/transfer.py` is used to prepare transfers, move them into the
pipelines processing location, and take actions when user input is required.
Only one transfer is sent to the pipeline at a time, the scripts wait until the
current transfer is resolved (failed, rejected or stored as an AIP) before
automatically starting the next available transfer.

Follow the steps below as an example for setting up a script.

1. Copy the configuration file:

    ```shell
    `cp /usr/lib/archivematica/automation-tools/etc/transfers.conf
    /etc/archivematica/automation-tools/`
    ```

2. Copy the script:

    ```shell
    cp /usr/lib/archivematica/automation-tools/etc/transfer-script.sh /etc/archivematica/automation-tools/
    ```

3. Create a transfer source for the automation-tools in the storage service:

    You can use an existing transfer source, or set up a new one. For Docker
    environments the standard transfer source is `$HOME/.am/ss-location-data/`.

    _Note_: If you run Docker as `sudo` the `.am` folder is owned by the root
    user. To use this folder you might want to change the folder permissions
    of `.am`.

4. Your default script should be configured along the lines of this:

    `transfer-script.sh`:

    ```shell
    #!/bin/bash
    # /etc/archivematica/automation-tools/transfer-script.sh
    cd /usr/lib/archivematica/automation-tools/
    # Use Python from the virtual environment.
    /usr/share/python/automation-tools/venv/bin/python -m transfers.transfer \
     --am-url http://archivematica-dashboard:8000 \
     --ss-url http://archivematica-storage-service:8000 \
     --user test \
     --api-key test  \
     --ss-user test \
     --ss-api-key test \
     --transfer-source <transfer-source-in-storage-service> \
     --config-file transfers.conf
    ```

5. Change permissions setting on the script:

    `chmod +x transfer-script.sh`

    This allows the script to be executible.

6. Run `./transfer-script.sh` and you should have success!

## Configuration

Suggested deployment is to use cron to run a shell script that runs the
automation transfer tool. Example shell script (for example in
`/etc/archivematica/automation-tools/transfer-script.sh`):

```shell
#!/bin/bash
cd /usr/lib/archivematica/automation-tools/
# Use the Python in the virtual environment.
/usr/share/python/automation-tools/venv/bin/python -m transfers.transfer \
  --user <user> \
  --api-key <apikey> \
  --ss-user <user> \
  --ss-api-key <apikey> \
  --transfer-source <transfer_source_uuid> \
  --config-file <config_file>
```

_Note_: the script calls the transfers script as a module using Python's `-m`
flag, this is required due to the use of relative imports in the code)

The script can be run from a shell window like:

```shell
user@host:/etc/archivematica/automation-tools$ sudo -u archivematica ./transfer-script.sh
```

It is suggested to run the script through a crontab entry for user archivematica
(to avoid the need to repeatedly invoke it manually):

```shell
*/5 * * * * /etc/archivematica/automation-tools/transfer-script.sh
```

When running, automated transfers stores its working state in a sqlite database.
It contains a record of all the transfers that have been processed. In a testing
environment, deleting this file will cause the tools to re-process any and all
folders found in the Transfer Source Location.

### Parameters

The `transfers.py` script can be modified to adjust how automated transfers
work.  The full set of parameters that can be changed are:

- `-u USERNAME, --user USERNAME` [REQUIRED]: Username of the Archivematica
  dashboard user to authenticate as.
- `-k KEY, --api-key KEY` [REQUIRED]: API key of the Archivematica dashboard
  user.
- `--ss-user USERNAME` [REQUIRED]: Username of the Storage Service user to
  authenticate as. Storage Service 0.8 and up requires this; earlier versions
  will ignore any value provided.
- `--ss-api-key KEY` [REQUIRED]: API key of the Storage Service user. Storage
  Service 0.8 and up requires this; earlier versions will ignore any value
  provided.
- `-t UUID, --transfer-source UUID`: [REQUIRED] Transfer Source Location UUID to
  fetch transfers from. Check the next section for more details on this field.
- `--transfer-path PATH`: Relative path within the Transfer Source. Default: ""
- `--depth DEPTH, -d DEPTH`: Depth to create the transfers from relative to the
  transfer source location and path. Default of 1 creates transfers from the
  children of transfer-path.
- `--am-url URL, -a URL`:Archivematica URL. Default: <http://127.0.0.1>
- `--ss-url URL, -s URL`: Storage Service URL. Default: <http://127.0.0.1:8000>
- `--transfer-type TYPE`: Type of transfer to start. One of: 'standard'
  (default), 'unzipped bag', 'zipped bag', 'dspace'.
- `--files`: If set, start transfers from files as well as folders.
- `--hide`: If set, hides the Transfer and SIP once completed.
- `--delete-on-complete`: If set, delete transfer source files from watched
  directory once completed.
- `-c FILE, --config-file FILE`: config file containing file paths for
  log/database/PID files. Default: log/database/PID files stored in the same
  directory as the script (not recommended for production)
- `-v, --verbose`: Increase the debugging output. Can be specified multiple
  times, e.g. `-vv`
- `-q, --quiet`: Decrease the debugging output. Can be specified multiple times,
  e.g. `-qq`
- `--log-level`: Set the level for debugging output. One of: 'ERROR', 'WARNING',
  'INFO', 'DEBUG'. This will override `-q` and `-v`

The `--config-file` specified can also be used to define a list of file
extensions that script files should have for execution. By default there is no
limitation, but it may be useful to specify this, for example `scriptextensions
= .py:.sh`. Multiple extensions may be specified, using '`:`' as a separator.

#### Setting processing rules

The easiest way to configure the tasks that automation-tools will run is by
using the dashboard:

1. Go to Administration > Processing Configuration and choose the options you
   wish to use.

2. Save the configuration on the form.

3. Copy the processing configuration file from
   `/var/archivematica/sharedDirectory/sharedMicroServiceTasksConfigs/
   processingMCPConfigs/defaultProcessingMCP.xml` on the Archivematica host
   machine to the `transfers/pre-transfer/` directory of your automation-tools
   installation location (also ensure that the `default_config.py` script exists
   in the same directory)

#### Getting the transfer source UUID

To obtain the transfer source UUID for script invocation, visit the 'Locations'
tab in the Archivematica Storage Service web UI.

#### Getting API keys

To get the Archivematica API key, log in to Archivematica as the user you wish
to authenticate as. From the dashboard, click your username in the top right
corner, then select 'Your profile'. The API key will be displayed at the bottom
of the page.

To get the Storage Service API key, log in to the Storage Service as the user
you wish to authenticate as. From the dashboard, go to *Administration > Users*
and select 'Edit' for the user you want the key for. The API key will be
displayed at the bottom of the page. Storage Service versions earlier than
`0.8.x` do not require an API key, and will not provide one. In that case, fill
in `--ss-user` and `--ss-api-key` with stub data, since those parameters are
required by automated transfers.

### Hooks

During processing, automate transfers will run scripts from several places to
customize behaviour. These scripts can be in any language. If they are written
in Python, we recommend making them source compatible with Python 2 or 3.

There are three places hooks can be used to change the automate tools behaviour.

- `transfers/get-accession-number` (script)
- `transfers/pre-transfer` (directory)
- `transfers/user-input` (directory)

Any new scripts added to these directories will automatically be run alongside
the existing scripts.

There are also several scripts provided for common use cases and examples of
processing that can be done. These are found in the `examples` directory sorted
by their usecase and can be copied or symlinked to the appropriate directory for
automation-tools to run them.

If you write a script that might be useful for others, please make a pull
request!

#### get-accession-id

- _Name:_ `get-accession-id`
- _Location:_ Same directory as transfers.py
- _Parameters:_ [`path`]
- _Return Code:_ 0
- _Output:_ Quoted value of the accession number (e.g. `"ID 42"`)

`get-accession-number` is run to customize the accession number of the created
transfer. Its single parameter is the path relative to the transfer source
location.  Note that no files are locally available when `get-accession-id` is
run. It should print to standard output the quoted value of the accession number
(e.g. `"ID42"`), `None`, or no output. If the return code is not 0, all output
is ignored. This is POSTed to the Archivematica REST API when the transfer is
created.

#### pre-transfer hooks

- _Parameters:_ [`absolute path`, `transfer type`]

All executable files found in `pre-transfer` are executed in alphabetical order
when a transfer is first copied from the specified Transfer Source Location to
the Archivematica pipeline. The return code and output of these scripts is not
evaluated.

All scripts are passed the same two parameters:

- `absolute path` is the absolute path on disk of the transfer
- `transfer type` is transfer type, the same as the parameter passed to the
  script. One of 'standard', 'unzipped bag', 'zipped bag', 'dspace'.

There are some sample scripts in the pre-transfers directory that may be useful,
or models for your own scripts.

- `00_unbag.py`: Repackages a bag as a standard transfer, writing md5 hashes
  from bag manifest into metadata/checksum.md5 file. This enables use of scripts
  such as add_metadata.py with bags, which would otherwise cause failure at the
  bag validation job.
- `add_metadata.py`: Creates a metadata.json file, by parsing data out of the
  transfer folder name.  This ends up as Dublin Dore in a dmdSec of the final
  METS file.
- `add_metadata_dspace.py`: Creates a metadata.csv file, by parsing data out of
  the dspace export name. This ends up as Dublin Dore in a dmdSec of the final
  METS file.
- `archivesspace_ids.py`: Creates an archivesspaceids.csv by parsing
  ArchivesSpace reference IDs from filenames.  This will automate the matching
  GUI if a DIP is uploaded to ArchivesSpace.
- `default_config.py`: Copies the included `defaultProcessingMCP.xml` into the
  transfer directory. This file overrides any configuration set in the
  Archivematica dashboard, so that user choices are guaranteed and avoided as
  desired.

#### user-input

- _Parameters:_ [`microservice name`, `first time at wait point`, `absolute
  path` , `unit UUID`, `unit name`, `unit type`]

All executable files in the `user-input folder` are executing in alphabetical
order whenever there is a transfer or SIP that is waiting at a user input
prompt. The return code and output of these scripts is not evaluated.

All scripts are passed the same set of parameters.

- `microservice name` is the name of the microservice awaiting user input. E.g.
  Approve Normalization
- `first time at wait point` is the string "True" if this is the first time the
  script is being run at this wait point, "False" if not. This is useful for
  only notifying the user once.
- `absolute path` is the absolute path on disk of the transfer
- `unit UUID` is the SIP or transfer's UUID
- `unit name` is the name of the SIP or transfer, not including the UUID.
- `unit type` is either "SIP" or "transfer"

There are some sample scripts in the pre-transfers directory that may be useful,
or models for your own scripts.

- `send_email.py`: Emails the first time a transfer is waiting for input at
  Approve Normalization.  It can be edited to change the email addresses it
  sends notices to, or to change the notification message.

### Logs

Logs are written to a directory specified in the config file (or
`/var/log/archivematica/automation-tools/` by default). The logging level can be
adjusted, by modifying the transfers/transfer.py file. Find the following
section and changed `'INFO'` to one of `'INFO'`, `'DEBUG'`, `'WARNING'`,
`'ERROR'` or `'CRITICAL'`.

```txt
'loggers': {
    'transfer': {
        'level': 'INFO',  # One of INFO, DEBUG, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
        'handlers': ['console', 'file'],
    },
},
```

### Multiple automated transfer instances

You may need to set up multiple automated transfer instances, for example if
required to ingest both standard transfers and bags. In cases where hooks are
the same for both instances, it could be achieved by setting up different
scripts, each one invoking the transfers.py script with the required parameters.
Example:

```shell
# first script invokes like this (standard transfer):
/usr/share/python/automation-tools/venv/bin/python -m transfers.transfer \
  --user <user>  \
  --api-key <apikey> \
  --ss-user <user> \
  --ss-api-key <apikey> \
  --transfer-source <transfer_source_uuid_for_std_xfers> \
  --config-file <config_file>

# second script invokes like this (unzipped bags):
/usr/share/python/automation-tools/venv/bin/python -m transfers.transfer \
  --user <user> \
  --api-key <apikey> \
  --ss-user <user> \
  --ss-api-key <apikey> \
  --transfer-source <transfer_source_2_uuid_for_bags> \
  --config-file <config_file_2> \
  --transfer-type 'unzipped bag'
```

`<config_file_1>` and `<config_file_2>` should specify different file names for
db/PID/log files. See transfers.conf and transfers-2.conf in etc/ for an example

In case different hooks are required for each instance, a possible approach is
to checkout a new instance of the automation tools, for example in
`/usr/lib/archivematica/automation-tools-2`

### `transfer_async.py`

This is a new work-in-progress entry point similar to `transfers.transfer` that
uses the new asynchronous endpoints of Archivematica being developed under the
`/api/v2beta` API. It takes the same arguments, e.g.:

```shell
#!/usr/bin/env bash

cd /usr/lib/archivematica/automation-tools/

/usr/share/python/automation-tools/venv/bin/python -m transfers.transfer_async \
  --user <user> --api-key <apikey> \
  --ss-user <user> --ss-api-key <apikey> \
  --transfer-source <transfer_source_uuid> \
  --config-file <config_file>
```

### Tips for ingesting DSpace exports

- At the transfer source location, put the DSpace item to be ingested in a
  subdirectory (e.g., `ITEM@123-4567/ITEM@123-4567.zip`)  . The scripts
  [here](https://github.com/artefactual-labs/transfer-source-helpers/) can be
  used for this purpose

- Use the add_metadata_dspace.py pre-transfer script (described in [pre-transfer
  hooks](#pre-transfer-hooks))

- Create a base `defaultProcessingMCP.xml` as described in [Getting Correct
  UUIDs and Setting Processing Rules](#setting-processing-rules), then append
  the following preconfigured choice to the xml:

```xml
    <!-- DSpace skips quarantine -->
    <preconfiguredChoice>
      <appliesTo>05f99ffd-abf2-4f5a-9ec8-f80a59967b89</appliesTo>
      <goToChain>d4404ab1-dc7f-4e9e-b1f8-aa861e766b8e</goToChain>
    </preconfiguredChoice>
```

- When invoking the transfers.py script, add the `--transfer-type dspace`
  parameter, for example:

```shell
/usr/share/python/automation-tools/venv/bin/python -m transfers.transfer \
  --transfer-type dspace \
  --user <user> \
  --api-key <apikey> \
  --ss-user <user> \
  --ss-api-key <apikey> \
  --transfer-source <transfer_source_uuid> \
  --config-file <config_file>
```

## DIP creation and upload

`aips/create_dip.py` and `aips/create_dips_job.py` can be used to make DIPs from
AIPs available in a Storage Service instance. Unlike DIPs created in
Archivematica, the ones created with this script will include only the original
files from the transfer and they will maintain the directories and filenames.

Based on the `--dip-type` parameter a few differences can be found in the
resulting DIPs:

- When using `zipped-objects`, the files will maintain the original last
  modified date and they will be placed with a copy of the
  submissionDocumentation folder and the AIP METS file in a single ZIP file
  under the objects directory. Based on the `--mets-type` parameter, another
  METS file will be generated alongside the objects folder containing only a
  reference to the ZIP file (without AMD or DMD sections), used to upload the
  DIP to an AtoM instance; or the same AIP METS file will be placed alongside
  the objects folder, used for uploads to the Storage Service.
- If `avalon-manifest` is used, the script will create a DIP ready for batch
  ingest into the Avalon Media System, relying on the Transfer name to move
  files into a Collection folder and will append Archivematica-minted UUIDs to
  the root-level Manifest file. **Do not use this type of the DIP in conjunction
  with the upload options explained below.**

While `aips/create_dip.py` only processes one AIP per execution,
`aips/create_dips_job.py` will process all AIPs in a given Storage Service
location, keeping track of them in an SQLite database. The latter also accepts
different subsets of parameters to automatically upload the created DIPs to the
Storage Service or to an AtoM instance. Both scripts require 7z to be installed
and available to extract the AIPs downloaded from the Storage Service.

As mentioned, the "zipped-objects" DIPs can be uploaded to AtoM or the Storage
Service using `dips.storage_service_upload` and `dips.atom_upload` or as part of
the `aips/create_dips_job.py` execution.

The AtoM upload requires a passwordless SSH connection to the AtoM host for the
user running the script. The AtoM host must be added to list of known hosts
using this [guide](https://wiki.archivematica.org/Upload_DIP#Send_your_DIPs_using_rsync).

The Storage Service upload requires access to the Archivematica pipeline's
currently processing location path (the shared path) in order to copy the DIP
folder in before sending a requests to the Storage Service to process that DIP.
The DIP creation request requires to configure the script with the credentials
from a Storage Service's administrator.

### DIP Configuration

Suggested use of these scripts is by using the example shell scripts in the
`etc` directory:

- [create_dip_script.sh](etc/create_dip_script.sh)
- [atom_upload_script.sh](etc/atom_upload_script.sh)
- [storage_service_upload_script.sh](etc/storage_service_upload_script.sh)
- [create_dips_job_script.sh](etc/create_dips_job_script.sh)
- [create_dips_job_atom_upload_script.sh](etc/create_dips_job_atom_upload_script.sh)
- [create_dips_job_ss_upload_script.sh](etc/create_dips_job_ss_upload_script.sh)

Note that the scripts call the DIP creation and upload scripts as modules using
Python's `-m` flag; this is required due to the use of relative imports in the
code.

The scripts can be run from a shell window, for example:

```shell
user@host:/etc/archivematica/automation-tools$ sudo -u archivematica ./create_dip_script.sh
```

For the scripts using `aips/create_dips_job.py`, it is suggested to run them
through a crontab entry for the archivematica user, to avoid the need to
repeatedly invoke it manually to keep processing the same location. E.g.:

```text
*/5 * * * * /etc/archivematica/automation-tools/create_dips_job_script.sh
```

To process multiple Storage Service locations, `create_dips_job_script.sh` and
similar scripts could be duplicated with a different set of parameters to call
`aips/create_dips_job.py` and be executed in the same manner.

#### Getting Storage Service API key

See [Getting API keys](#getting-api-keys)

## DIP export to NetX

The _dips/copy_to_netx.py_ script is a command line tool that takes a DIP
directory, typically in the `watchedDirectories/uploadDIP` subdirectory of the
Archivematica shared directory, and exports data to NetX. The script copies
the objects in the DIP, and writes CSV data describing the objects, to
directories that NetX imports from.

The component ID recorded in the NetX CSV can either be:

1) Specified as a command line option (`--component-id`)
2) Specified using JSON metadata

If specifiying the component ID using JSON metadata you'll need to put a file
called `netx.json` in a `metadata` directory in your transfer. The contents of
this file should be similar to the example JSON shown below:

```text
[{"component.identifier": "someidentifier"}]
```

The object ID recorded in the NetX CSV can either be:

1) Specified as a command line option (`--object-id`)
2) Specified using the accession number

### `dips/copy_to_netx.py`

- `--dip-path PATH` [REQUIRED]: Absolute path to a local DIP to copy from.
- `--netx-csv-directory PATH` [REQUIRED]: Absolute path to the NetX CSV
  directory.
- `--netx-objects-directory PATH` [REQUIRED]: Absolute path to the NetX objects
  directory.
- `--object-id ID`: Object ID to specify when adding to the NetX CSV.
- `--component-id ID`: Component ID to specify when adding to the NetX CSV.
- `--working-directory PATH`: Absolute path in which a temporary working
  directory will be created. Defaults to system's temp directory.
- `--delete-local-copy`: To use alongside the upload arguments explained bellow
  and remove the local DIP after it has been uploaded.
- `--log-file PATH`: Absolute path to a file to output the logs. Otherwise it
  will be created in the script directory.
- `-v, --verbose`: Increase the debugging output. Can be specified multiple
  times, e.g. `-vv`
- `-q, --quiet`: Decrease the debugging output. Can be specified multiple times,
  e.g. `-qq`
- `--log-level`: Set the level for debugging output. One of: 'ERROR', 'WARNING',
  'INFO', 'DEBUG'. This will override `-q` and `-v`

## Reingest

The _transfers/reingest.py_ script is a module and CLI (command line interface)
tool that provides functionality for bulk-reingest of compressed AIPs. Given a
user formatted list of AIP UUIDs it can complete the bulk-reingest of any AIP
listed.

An example list that could be stored in a text file might be:

```text
   ["54369f6a-aa82-4b29-80c9-834d3625397d",
    "b18801dd-30ec-46ba-ac6b-4cb561585ac9",
    "b4d37c2c-df30-4a16-8f2f-4cb02a5d53cb"]
```

Alternatively the command can be configured using the `--processfromstorage`
switch to identify compressed archives in the storage service and the transfer
initiated that way.

Command line switches can be seen by running the script without any other
arguments:

```shell
$ python -m transfers.reingest
usage: reingest.py [-h] --config CONFIG [--listcompressedaips]
                   [--compareaiplist COMPAREAIPLIST]
                   [--processfromlist PROCESSFROMLIST] [--processfromstorage]
                   [--dbstatus] [--logging [LOGGING]]

Reingest AIPs Automatically. Created for CCArch to reingest compressed AIPs
using an alternative Archivematica ProcessingMCP.xml file. A work in progress,
with some improvements that can be made to long-running processes like this
over time.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --config CONFIG       REQUIRED: configure the script
  --listcompressedaips  list compressed AIPs in storage
  --compareaiplist COMPAREAIPLIST
                        compare stored compressed aips with an existing list
  --processfromlist PROCESSFROMLIST
                        reingest from a list of UUIDs
  --processfromstorage  reingest compressed AIPs from the Storage Service
  --dbstatus            output log from the database
  --logging [LOGGING]   logging level, INFO, DEBUG, WARNING, ERROR
```

Configuration of reingest.py is done via _transfers/reingestconfig.json_. You
will need to configure API parameters via `reingestconfig.json`. See notes
above about finding the Archivematica and Storage Service API keys. An example
configuration with placeholder parameters is provided in
[reingestconfig.json](transfers/reingestconfig.json)

*Reingest.py* is best used via the shell script provided in the
[_transfers/examples/reingest_](transfers/examples/reingest) folder. As it is
designed for bulk-reingest, it is best used in conjunction with a cronfile, an
example of which is provided in the same folder.

State is recorded in an sqlite database. When the script is executed over and
over the state is updated or read. Progress is then stored in a separate log
file.

The log file _reingest.log_ will either be under _transfers/reingest.log_ or
somewhere else specified in your _reingestconfig.json_ file.

We can review _reingest.log_ to see where in the process the reingest is:

1. First time the code is run we can see reingest begin and its automatic
   approval in the pipeline:

```shell
$ ./run-reingest.sh

INFO      2018-10-25 23:59:19 reingest.py:422  Processing throttle set to 1, approval retries set to 2

INFO      2018-10-25 23:59:21 reingest.py:194  Removing PID for current process.
```

1. While the reingest progresses we can see that there isn't an ingest to
   monitor, and the status doesn't need updating.

```shell
$ ./run-reingest.sh

INFO      2018-10-25 23:59:39 reingest.py:422  Processing throttle set to 1, approval retries set to 2

```

1. Once the ingest stage of the workflow has started, the state is updated.

```shell
$ ./run-reingest.sh

INFO      2018-10-26 00:00:03 reingest.py:422  Processing throttle set to 1, approval retries set to 2

INFO      2018-10-26 00:00:03 reingest.py:194  Removing PID for current process.
```

1. Following completion of the first reingest, a second is started and we can
   see similar log entries to those in *1.*

```shell
$ ./run-reingest.sh

INFO      2018-10-26 00:00:26 reingest.py:422  Processing throttle set to 1, approval retries set to 2

```

The database file _reingest.db_ will either be under _transfers/reingest.db_ or
somewhere else specified in your _reingestconfig.json_ file.

The database can be read using tools capable of reading an sqlite database,
e.g. [sqlite3](https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/sqlite3). A snippet of the
database might look as follows:

```console
aip_uuid                              transfer_uuid                         status           message     start_time                  end_time
------------------------------------  ------------------------------------  ---------------  ----------  --------------------------  --------------------------
1dd914ad-520d-447f-8207-c49aaad5612d  7b0bef8e-ad64-4f74-967e-258299f38272  STATUS_COMPLETE              2018-10-25 21:59:21.304078  2018-10-25 22:00:26.772603

3c5bf34c-1001-4ea3-8d59-a7989e6f73ca                                        STATUS_NEW
cca46884-eb6e-4a50-95b5-a99630e1bc4b                                        STATUS_NEW
```

Here we can see one transfer is complete (`STATUS_COMPLETE`). One is in
progress (`STATUS_IN_PROGRESS`). Two are new (`STATUS_NEW`) and are
yet to be processed.

Once all AIPs selected to be reingested are done, the status will read
`STATUS-COMPLETE`.

`STATUS_ERROR` may also be shown. Archivematica does not provide detailed error
information via its API as of yet, and so, if an error does occur, the user is
expected to find the AIP in the pipeline and look at which jobs may have
failed.

If the transfer or ingest has already been removed from the dashboard then the
information could be found by looking up the status of the microservices:

Via the user interface:

- *http://{archivematica-url}}/transfer/{UUID}/*
- *http://{archivematica-url}}/ingest/{UUID}/*

Via the API (users will need to filter on package UUID):

- *http://{archivematica-url}}/transfer/status/*
- *http://{archivematica-url}}/ingest/status/*
