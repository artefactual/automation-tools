Feature: Identify true duplicates in the Archivematica AIP store.

Background: Alma uses checksums and archival context to determine "true" duplicate files in their collection (i.e. the context of creation and use is identical).

Scenario: Generate a duplicate report
    Given an AIP has been ingested
    When a duplicate checksum is found
    Then a duplicates report is generated
    
Scenario Outline: Detect a true duplicate file
    Given a duplicates report is available
    When a file's <properties> are equivalent
    Then the files are true duplicates

    Examples:
    | properties    |
    | AIP dir_name  |  
    | base_name     |
    | file_path     |
    | date_modified |
